# React - Node/Express Demo

### Technology used
- React on the client side
- Node.js/Express on the server side

## Instructions on installation and running
The code is split into two parts:
- server-side (in the `server` folder)
- client-side (in the `client` folder)
The application needs both the server and the client to run concurrently. In the development environment this is achieved by running the two in separate terminal windows.

### Server
- Change to the `server` directory 
- run `yarn install` to install dependencies
- run `yarn start` to run the server at http://localhost:3001

### Client
- Change to the `client` directory
- run `yarn install` to install dependencies
- run `yarn start` to run the client at http://localhost:3000
